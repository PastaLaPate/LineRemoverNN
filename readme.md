# Line Remover NN

## Introduction
This repos uses PyTorch to remove ruled lines from an image.
The goal of this model is to make easier the word recognition from OCR 

## Usage
### Install Requirements
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Install IAM Dataset
First go to `/data/` and run `python downloadData.py`
### Preprocess the data (generated pages and split pages to blocks)
